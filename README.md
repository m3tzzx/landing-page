## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned from this project how to make a landing page by using flexbox. I have strageled with flexbox in the past but I finally understood it. Anthor thing I learned is how
to make a good layout of the element of the bage.

### Continued development

I would like to develop my flexbox skills because I found that it is a powerful tool that can get me out from bad situations.

### Useful resources

- [Interneting is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html) - This helped me to understand flexbox. I really liked this page and how it structured and I think
it is a great resource.
- [Interactive guide to flexbox by Josh Wcomeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
